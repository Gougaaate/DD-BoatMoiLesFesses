# DDBOAT python3 drivers version 2

The drivers are :
* IMU (MAG, ACCEL, GYRO) : imu9_driver_v2.py
* GPS (serial line, GPGLL message) : gps_driver_v2.py
* Encoders on propeller rotation (serial line) : encoders_driver_v2.py
* Arduino motors command (serial line) : arduino_driver_v2.py
* TC74 temperature sensors (one per motor) : tc74_driver_v2.py

## testing the drivers on your ddboat

First, you will have to clone this repo on your laptop
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.ensta-bretagne.fr/zerrbe/drivers-ddboat-v2.git
```

Then you will have to upload the drivers on your ddboat
We assume we are on ddboat 7 and  the folder of your team is mywrk (replace with your own values, mywrk should be a different name for all teams to avoid interferences)
```
$ scp -r drivers-ddboat-v2 ue32@172.20.25.207:mywrk
```

Now we open another terminal on the ddboat:
```
$ ssh ue32@172.20.25.207
$ cd mywrk
```
Now, the drivers can be tested. For each driver, a small test is provided in the **main** section. This allows both to test and to show how to use the sensors and the actuators. For example to test the temperature sensors :
```
$ python3 tc74_driver_v2.py
```
or, to test the GPS :
```
$ python3 gps_driver_v2.py
```
When using the motors (arduino driver), **be careful and make sure the propellers can freely rotate !!**

## using the screen command to work outside of the WIFI Network

When using WIFI, the terminal is locked when the WIFI connection is lost.
The ddboat wil stop working properly.
A solution is to use the **screen** command to detach the session from the terminal.
First, we start a screen session called sesddboat (or whatsoever name)

```
$ screen -S sesddboat
```
Note that screen creates a new terminal (and you loose the command history for recent commands)
We can now check that the session is attached
```
$ screen -ls
```
should give :
```
There is a screen on:
        1404.sesddboat     (09/29/21 16:42:04)     (Attached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-pi.

```
The screen commands start with Ctrl+A. You can see a list of usefull commands here :

https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/

Now, we can detach the screen session from the terminal by typing Ctrl+A d
and we can check that the session is actually detached :
```
$ screen -ls
```
should give :
```
There is a screen on:
	1404.sesddboat	(09/29/21 16:42:04)	(Detached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-pi.
```

Now the ddboat can work outside the WIFI coverage. To get access back (resume access) to the session when the ddboat is back in WIFI area, type :
```
screen -r
```
we are back on line with the ddboat !

A last usefull command is to fully stop the screen command, one way to do it is :

```
$ screen -X -S sesddboat quit
```

where sesddboat is the session name the has been used at the start.

Example (log the GPS in a gpx file)
```
$ screen -S sesgps
$ python3 tst_gpx.py (in the drivers-ddboat-v2 folder)
$ CTRL+A d  
now you can go outside the WIFI area and acquire a GPS track
when it's done, recover the session
$ screen -r
$ CTRL+C to stop the acquisition
a file called tst.gpx has been created, rename it to save the data
$ mv tst.gpx mynicetrack.gpx
we can now destroy the session
$ screen -X -S  sesgps quit
```


## working with GPS

The following packets must have been installed :
```
$ sudo apt install python3-gpxpy python3-pyproj
```

The GPS is acquired and the GPGLL message is recorded in GPX format (so you can plot it in GeoPortail for example) in the **tst.gpx** file with the command:
```
$ python3 tst_gpx.py
```

In the NMEA message GPGLL, the latitude and longitude are given in DDmm.mmmm with DD in degrees and mm.mmmm in decimal minutes. To get the value in decimal degrees we do DD + mm.mmmm/60.0

Using a projection from degrees (longitude,latitude in WGS84) to meters (UTM zone 30N) we can compute the distance in meter to a reference point. The following command executes a test:
```
$ python3 tst_proj.py
```

The gpx file can be display on **GeoPortail**. To show it on **GoogleEarth** the simpliest way is to convert it in kml :
```
$ gpsbabel -i gpx -f file.gpx -o kml -F file.kml


## remote install drivers for tests

From a remote computer use rcp and rsh , example for DDBOAT 5
```
$ scp install.bash pi@172.20.25.205:/tmp/
$ rsh 172.20.25.205 -l pi /tmp/install.bash
```
